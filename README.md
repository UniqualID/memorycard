# üÉè Memory Card Game

A modern, full-stack, multi-theme memory card game built with the latest and greatest in web technology. This project is a flex of your React, Vite, CSS, and API-integration skills, with a modular, extensible architecture and a beautiful, responsive UI.

## üöÄ Tech Stack & Features

### **Languages & Frameworks**
- **React 19**: Lightning-fast, component-based UI with hooks and functional components.

  - `PlayingCard`  
  - `PokemonCard`  
  - `NumberCard`  
  - `RickAndMortyCard`
- **StartForm**: Dynamic game setup with selectable card types and difficulty.
- **Loading**: Animated loading spinner for async API fetches.

### **UX & UI**
